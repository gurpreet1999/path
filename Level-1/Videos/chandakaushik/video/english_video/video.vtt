00:00:00.905 --> 00:00:01.822
Chandkaushik

00:00:03.406 --> 00:00:04.970
This is from the time 

00:00:05.503 --> 00:00:08.069
when Mahaveer Swami took diksha and was wandering.

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:16.583
He was always busy in meditation, austerity, fasting, penance etc.

00:00:19.856 --> 00:00:23.453
One day he decided to go to Vachala village

00:00:24.213 --> 00:00:27.481
The way to go there passed through a forest

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.703
A snake named Chandkaushik used to live in that forest

00:00:34.874 --> 00:00:36.351
He was very poisonous

00:00:37.304 --> 00:00:41.511
It was said that even if he looked at someone,

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.602
that person would die

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:50.324
That's why the people living around the forest used to be very scared

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:52.253
When people came to know

00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:57.690
that Lord Mahavir Swami was about to travel through the forest,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.928
they asked him to take another route,

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.864
but He was Lord Mahavir Swami

00:01:05.704 --> 00:01:08.434
who practiced 'Ahimsa Parmo Dharma'

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.833
He had neither any fear

00:01:12.464 --> 00:01:15.785
nor any feeling of condemnation towards anyone

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.565
There was always a sense of peace and kindness on his face

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:23.743
That's why he explained to the villagers

00:01:24.535 --> 00:01:28.497
and decided to walk through the forest only.

00:01:30.497 --> 00:01:34.435
While walking, when he moved forward through the forest,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.635
he saw dry grass as soon, as he went a little distance.

00:01:43.187 --> 00:01:45.185
All the trees and plants had dried up.

00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:49.736
The whole forest seemed like a dry battlefield.

00:01:50.754 --> 00:01:51.705
Lord understood

00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:54.839
that Chandkaushik was somewhere nearby

00:01:55.647 --> 00:01:57.877
and he stood there to meditate.

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:03.963
As soon as Chandkaushik came to know

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.770
that there was someone near the pit,

00:02:07.514 --> 00:02:09.464
he came out of it.

00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:15.379
Seeing a person in front of him,

00:02:15.945 --> 00:02:17.898
he got angry and started thinking

00:02:18.593 --> 00:02:22.465
"He has so much courage that he is standing at my place ?"

00:02:23.548 --> 00:02:26.852
Chandkaushik started to scare Lord Mahavir.

00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:30.307
He did not know about the power of the Bhagwant.

00:02:33.604 --> 00:02:37.597
He got ready to bite him, by spreading his hood in anger,

00:02:38.586 --> 00:02:42.836
but seeing that it was not having any effect on the Lord

00:02:43.887 --> 00:02:46.117
nor was he running away from there,

00:02:47.006 --> 00:02:49.800
Chandkaushik became very angry

00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:54.000
and gave venomous stings to Lord Mahavir Swami three times,

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.954
but It had no effect on Lord Mahavir Swami.

00:03:01.827 --> 00:03:05.641
Neither anything happened to him nor his attention was distracted.

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:12.000
Seeing this, Chandkaushik got very upset and got furious

00:03:13.114 --> 00:03:15.930
and stung the Lord's thumb again.

00:03:17.107 --> 00:03:20.602
This time he saw that nothing happened to the Bhagwant,

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.969
but instead of blood, a stream of milk was flowing out of his thumb.

00:03:27.065 --> 00:03:31.510
He saw that there was no fear or anger on Lord Mahavir Swami's face,

00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:34.823
but only compassion.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.551
He opened his eyes

00:03:38.197 --> 00:03:40.524
and looking at Chandkaushik said -

00:03:42.286 --> 00:03:44.370
Lord Mahavir : "O Chandkaushik! Be calm, be calm!

00:03:46.245 --> 00:03:50.496
Lord Mahavir : ""O Chandkaushik! Be calm, be calm!

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:57.108
Lord Mahavir : "Try to understand what you are doing."

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.375
These words full of love and compassion

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:04.090
showed their effect on Chandkaushik

00:04:04.866 --> 00:04:06.501
and he became calm.

00:04:07.681 --> 00:04:09.766
When he calmed down, he thought

00:04:10.525 --> 00:04:13.417
that he had seen such saint somewhere before.

00:04:14.534 --> 00:04:18.703
By the grace of the Lord, he remembered his two previous births

00:04:34.091 --> 00:04:37.016
and he understood the truth of his life.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.403
He saw that it was because of anger and pride that he became Chandkaushik.

00:04:44.425 --> 00:04:49.102
He decided that now he has to leave anger and become calm

00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:55.368
and then he bowed down at the feet of the Lord 
 with great respect

00:04:55.368 --> 00:04:57.468
and went back to his pit.

00:04:58.794 --> 00:05:00.183
When people came to know about this

00:05:00.959 --> 00:05:03.840
that now Chandkaushik does not harm anyone,

00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:06.522
Some people even started worshiping him

00:05:07.282 --> 00:05:09.867
and started offering him milk and food.

00:05:11.081 --> 00:05:16.309
Because of the milk and food, 
 the ants stung him on his entire body.

00:05:17.295 --> 00:05:20.309
Still he lay calm without getting angry

00:05:21.198 --> 00:05:25.025
and died a few days later.

00:05:25.898 --> 00:05:30.197
Due to self-control and mastering anger

00:05:30.811 --> 00:05:33.421
his sins were destroyed

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:36.284
and he attained heaven.

00:05:37.448 --> 00:05:39.290
Fear, anger and ego,

00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:45.385
are not violence towards others, but self-harm.

00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:51.460
A reflection of this can be observed in the present life of Chandakaushik.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.327
Hence, we should abandon these 

00:05:55.973 --> 00:06:00.272
and adopt a correct attitude fearlessly.

00:06:01.598 --> 00:06:02.238
So kids!

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:06.503
Due to anger and pride in the previous birth,

00:06:07.214 --> 00:06:09.636
he had to become "Chandkaushik" the snake, in this birth,

00:06:10.492 --> 00:06:15.779
but after being calm and tolerating anger with equanimity,

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.000
he attained Devlok.

00:06:18.988 --> 00:06:24.078
If we give up anger, we too shall attain salvation.
